          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Worship Presenter is a specialized software solution designed to
            meet the unique needs of religious organizations. During worship
            services, the management of song lyrics, scripture readings, and
            multi-modal media can be complex and error-prone. This project was
            born out of a desire to create a tool that is both powerful and
            accessible to volunteers who may not have extensive technical
            training.
          </p>

          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            Many existing presentation tools are either too generic or overly
            complex, requiring steep learning curves. Church environments often
            operate with limited resources and rely on volunteers. The challenge
            was to build a system that manages dynamic content in real-time
            while providing a distraction-free environment for the congregation.
          </p>

          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <p>
            I developed a web-based platform using
            <strong>Node.js, Express, and Nunjucks</strong>. By leveraging
            modern web standards, Worship Presenter provides a fast, responsive
            interface that can be operated from any device with a browser. Key
            features include:
          </p>
          <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 2rem 1.5rem; color: var(--text-muted)">
            <li>
              <strong>Intuitive Setlist Management:</strong> Quickly organize
              songs and scripture for a specific service.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Live Preview & Control:</strong> Operators can see exactly
              what is on the screen while managing the next slide.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Database Integration:</strong> Efficiently search and
              store thousands of song lyrics and bibliographic data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Customizable Themes:</strong> Easily adjust typography and
              backgrounds to match the church's visual identity.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
          <p>
            On the frontend, I focused on heavy optimization to ensure zero-lag
            during slide transitions. On the backend, I implemented a robust
            session management system to allow multiple controllers to sync with
            the main display. This distributed architecture allows for high
            flexibility in various church setups.
          </p>

          <h3>Outcome & Impact</h3>
          <p>
            Worship Presenter has significantly reduced the preparation time for
            Sunday services. Users report a 40% reduction in slide-related
            errors, allowed the focus of the service to remain on the worship
            experience itself.
